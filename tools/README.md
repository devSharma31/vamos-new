# Load-Test Tools

Use the same tool(s) as in the dissertation.
- If you used **JMeter**, place your `.jmx` test plan here: `tools/jmeter/plan.jmx`, and export graphs as PNGs into `/evidence/graphs`.
- If you also used **k6** (only if it’s in the dissertation), add your script under `tools/k6/`.

This repo mirrors the dissertation; we do not introduce tools that were not used in the report.
